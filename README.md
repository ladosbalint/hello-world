# hello-world
This is my very first repository on GitHub. I hope that it will lead me to a deeper understanding of how this system works.
I am a 16 years old web developer from Hungary. I really like programming as well. In my free time, I try spending as much of my time as possible with web development.
I have already received my Front End Developer certificate by FreeCodeCamp. In my future, I would like to continue my studies and learn more in order to become a better web developer.
